Introduction
------------

The purpose of the :mod:`importlib` package is two-fold. One is to provide an
implementation of the :keyword:`import` statement (and thus, by extension, the
:func:`__import__` function) in Python source code. This provides an
implementaiton of :keyword:`import` which is portable to any Python
interpreter. This also provides a reference implementation which is easier to
read than one in a programming language other than Python.

Two, the components to implement :keyword:`import` can be exposed in this
package, making it easier for users to create their own custom objects (known
generically as importers) to participate in the import process. Details on
providing custom importers can be found in :pep:`302`.

        Original specification of packages. Some semantics have changed since
        the writing of this document (e.g. redirecting based on :keyword:`None`
        in :data:`sys.modules`).

    The :func:`.__import__` function
        The built-in function for which the :keyword:`import` statement is
        syntactic sugar for.

Functions
---------

.. function:: __import__(name, globals={}, locals={}, fromlist=list(), level=0)

    An implementation of the built-in :func:`__import__` function. See the
    built-in function's documentation for usage instructions.

.. function:: import_module(name, package=None)

    Import a module. The *name* argument specifies what module to
    import in absolute or relative terms
    (e.g. either ``pkg.mod`` or ``..mod``). If the name is
    specified in relative terms, then the *package* argument must be
    set to the package which is to act as the anchor for resolving the
    package name (e.g. ``import_module('..mod', 'pkg.subpkg')`` will import
    ``pkg.mod``).

    The :func:`import_module` function acts as a simplifying wrapper around
    :func:`__import__`. This means all semantics of the function are derived
    from :func:`__import__`, including requiring the package where an import is
    occuring from to already be imported (i.e., *package* must already be
    imported).

:mod:`importlib.machinery` -- Importers and path hooks
------------------------------------------------------

.. module:: importlib.machinery
    :synopsis: Importers and path hooks

This module contains the various objects that help :keyword:`import`
find and load modules.

.. class:: BuiltinImporter

    :term:`Importer` for built-in modules. All known built-in modules are
    listed in :data:`sys.builtin_module_names`.

    Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
    instantiation.

    .. classmethod:: find_module(fullname, path=None)

        Class method that allows this class to be a :term:`finder` for built-in
        modules.

    .. classmethod:: load_module(fullname)

        Class method that allows this class to be a :term:`loader` for built-in
        modules.


.. class:: FrozenImporter

    :term:`Importer` for frozen modules.

    Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
    instantiation.

    .. classmethod:: find_module(fullname, path=None)

        Class method that allows this class to be a :term:`finder` for frozen
        modules.

    .. classmethod:: load_module(fullname)

        Class method that allows this class to be a :term:`loader` for frozen
        modules.
